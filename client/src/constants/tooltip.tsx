        <li>
          <strong>Tier 1:</strong> Utilizes global default emission factors,
          offering a general yearly estimate per hectare, suitable when local
          data is unavailable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tier 2:</strong> Uses country-specific values derived from
          literature sources, modeling Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) and Soil
          Organic Carbon (SOC) emissions separately. Note: Tier 2 default values
          are not available for all ecosystems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tier 3:</strong> Enables the use of project-specific emission
          factors, which can be entered either as a single value (similar to
          Tier 1) or as separate AGB and SOC values (similar to Tier 2), based
          on the specific data available for the project.

        following the appropriate conversion to CO2e.

        tCO2e per hectare per year.

  SOC_EMISSIONS: (
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>SOC and AGB separately:</strong> Tier 3 - Separate AGB and SOC
        allows for the entry of project-specific emission factors for both
        Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), each expressed
        in tCO2e per hectare per year. By separating AGB and SOC, this approach
        enables a more detailed and tailored estimate of carbon sequestration
        and emissions specific to the project site. The AGB value represents the
        committed emissions from aboveground vegetation, such as trees, shrubs,
        and other plant matter, while the SOC value accounts for the carbon
        stored in the soil. Both of these emission factors are influenced by
        local conditions, land use practices, and ecosystem characteristics.
        Entering these values separately provides a more precise reflection of
        the project&apos;s carbon dynamics and allows for a more accurate
        calculation of overall emissions reductions or sequestration potential.
